# TimeSeg: An Information-Theoretic Segment-Level Explainer for Time-Series Predictions

## Overview

Explaining predictions of black-box time-series models remains a challenging problem due to the dynamically evolving patterns within individual sequences and their complex temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, existing explanation methods largely focus on point-wise explanations, which fail to capture broader temporal context, while methods that attempt to highlight interpretable temporal patterns~(\eg achieved by incorporating a regularizer or fixed-length patches) often lack principled definitions of meaningful segments. This limitation frequently leads to fragmented and confusing explanations for end users. 
As such, the notion of segment-level explanations has remained underexplored, with little consensus on what constitutes an \textit{interpretable} segment or how such segments should be identified. To bridge this gap, we define segment-level explanation for black-box time-series models as the task of selecting contiguous subsequences that maximize their joint mutual information with the target prediction. Building on this formulation, we propose \name, a novel information-theoretic framework that employs reinforcement learning to sequentially identify predictive temporal segments at a per-instance level. 
By doing so, \name produces segment-wise explanations that capture holistic temporal patterns rather than fragmented points, providing class-predictive patterns in a human-interpretable manner. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and realâ€‘world datasets demonstrate that \name produces more coherent and human-understandable explanations, while achieving performance that matches or surpasses existing methods on downstream tasks using the identified segments.

# Quick Start

## 1) Create and activate a conda env (Python 3.9)

```bash
conda env create --name time-segment python==3.9
conda activate time-segment
```

## 2) Install python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/TimeSynth/TimeSynth.git
cd TimeSynth
python setup.py install
cd ..
```

## 3) Run
```bash
bash main.sh
```
This will launch the partial pipeline with default settings (train or load the black-box model)
